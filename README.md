This project will ultimately optimize the complete web :)

## Information

This project is currently still in early development. All images in the pull requests that are submitted are tested to be 100% pixel by pixel the same as their originals. (They are just smaller :smile:).

If you have any questions, suggestions or other ideas, let me know.

## Help my repository got optimized!?!?

Currently I'm just manually choosing some github repositories to optimize, mainly to further extend the project and add more types of images to support. So if your project is one of the few that got optimized, feel free to accept my pull request and start making the web a tiny bit faster :smile:.
